**Fundamental physics is an attempt at approximating the universe's source code.**  
**AI will probably find it.**  

If new ideas are clever linear combinations of previous ideas[^1], it seems that artificial neural networks will be the ones coming up most new theories and inventions by virtue of their computational speed.  

This is exciting (and pretty scary), and on this page, I want to **explore the basics of deep learning in neural networks**.

[^1]: *Even Einstein, arguably the smartest person ever, got special relativity by combining Galilean relativity, the absence of an ether (as implied by the recently conducted Michelson-Morley experiment), and a fixed speed of light as given by the solution to Maxwell's equations. 
As far as I can tell, all new "idea vectors" are constructed from previous "idea vectors" in some fixed-dimensional space.*
