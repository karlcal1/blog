    "text": "I’ve spent most of my life on learning the foundation of the physical world.\nI’ll spend the rest on figuring out what thinking is as related to inventing safer and better models.\n\nStarting early Sept. 2025, I’m an interpretability researcher at CHAI (Center for Human-Compatible AI)/BAIR (Berkeley AI Research lab) with Cam Allen.\nI’m also a 4th-year physics major at Berkeley.\nUntil late Aug. 2025, I was a particle physics researcher at the Neutrino Group at SLAC under Professor Hirohisa Tanaka. I used latent spaces to investigate the low-energy excess of electron neutrinos detected in the MiniBooNE experiment.\nBefore SLAC, I worked on Bayesian analysis for Mu2e under Professor Yury Kolomensky.\nBefore Berkeley, I wanted to experience “real life” – so I went all in and took a half a year to work as a trash man. Then I went to South America for a half a year. Things like the deadly fear I felt when running from wild dogs in the desert gave me clarity on what matters in life.\nI love language and spend more than half of my time speaking languages other than English (~ 30% Chinese, 30% English, 15% Spanish, 15% Swedish/Norwegian, 10% Italian)\nApart from family and friends, my values have been influenced greatly by Marcus Aurelius’s Meditations, Confucius’s Lunyu ( 论语 ), Noah Harari’s Homo sapiens, and, honestly, Avatar the Last Airbender and SpongeBob. The most transformative read of my life was when I read Joanne Baker’s 50 Physics Ideas You Really Need to Know as a kid.\n\nI love chatting about the geometry of thinking and other AI topics over a boba!
